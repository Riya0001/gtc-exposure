To download directories for the ratio methods with the optimised model weights and sample coastlines, damage assessments and building footprints, please run the following command in your terminal:

`'bash download_data.sh'` from location `'./gtc-exposure/change_detection/ratio_method'`

This is necessary to run the demo notebooks. Then start by diving into the `image_ratio_demo.ipynb` notebook to visualise the method outputs for some sample locations or by specifying your own location. You will then see links within this notebook directing you to the `thresholding.ipynb` and `unet_classifier.ipynb` notebooks. These are firstly for if would like a better understanding of the gritty details of the methods, or if hopefully you are here to take the method further and build atop this work. The `.py` files in this directory contain functions imported to the notebooks and are not designed to be run as standalone python scripts. 

Have fun and email lshc3@cam.ac.uk if you have any questions!
