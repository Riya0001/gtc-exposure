### Deep change detection

This directory contains code for the deep learning approach to change detection on Sentinel-2 data. cd_dl_notebook
contains the code used to train and test the U-Net model. 

Weights for the trained U-Net model are available in the weights directory.

Additional loss function are provided in losses.py.

Example images (included results of the change detection algorithm) can be found in example_images.
