This model evaluates change per 'image tile' of which there will be many within your area of interest. Therefore, first let's draw a polygon over the desired area. Then, each corresponding tile will individually be fed in to the model for assessing change detection. Bare in mind the larger the area the longer it will take to run the model for that area.\n",
