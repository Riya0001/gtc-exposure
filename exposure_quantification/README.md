According to the Caribbean Handbook on Risk Information Management (http://www.charim.net/methodology/51), exposure is the spatial overlay of hazard footprints and elements-at-risk locations. Hazard footprints show the temporal probability of of a specific hazard scenario with a given return period in an area, and elements-at-risk refers to everything potentially exposed to hazards that has value. 

Since our project focuses specifically on informal settlements in the Caribbean, the most prominent elements-at-risk there are buildings and people, and the natural hazards that Caribbean countries suffer most from are flood, hurricane, earthquake, and tsunami. There exist many projects that provide information on built-up areas, population density, and hazard footprints globally. For example, WorldPop (https://www.worldpop.org/) and LandScan (https://landscan.ornl.gov/) provide population counts at approximately 100m and 1km spatial resolution, respectively, and the Global Urban Footprint (https://www.dlr.de/eoc/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-9628/16557_read-40454/) maps settlements worldwide with around 12m spatial resolution.

For our project, we used the built-up (https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/016d1a34-b184-42dc-b586-e10b915dd863) and population (https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/0c6b9751-a71f-4062-830b-43c9f432370f) layers from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project, as well as the hazard maps from the Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (https://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2015/en/home/index.html). These two projects provide information on either elements-at-risk or hazard footprints in one place and in a consistent manner. 

The exposure quantification demo notebook produces the overlay of GHSL built-up layer, population layer, and Sentinel-2 image for the informal settlement in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
